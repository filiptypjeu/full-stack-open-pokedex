In python the two most popular linters are Flake8 and Pylint, and both of them can be installed via pip. Pylint seems to be a bit more comprehensive, while Flake8 is a bit simpler but will definitely get the job done. For testing, Python nowadays has a built in unittest framework module. Python code can be deployed as is, so there does not have to be a building step at all.

There seem to be a lot of tools available for setting up a CI pipeline in general. After a bit of googling the most popular tools, aside from Jenkins and GitHub Actions, seem to be Bamboo, TeamsCity, CircleCI, Buddy amd Travis-CI. All of these can be both self-hosted and run in the cloud, except TeamCity that only supports self-hosting and Travis-CI which is a cloud-hosted service only. If your software is open-source I would highly suggest Travis-CI, because testing open-source software with Travis-CI can be done free of charge.

Python projects are often kept small and my preferred way of using Python is to quickly build small scripts and proof-of-concepts that later can be replicated in a better suited language. This is not to say that you can't write huge projects in Python with for example Django, but I still think that Python projects usually can be tested and deployed using a cloud-based CI tool and that using a self-hosted one gives little to no advantage.
